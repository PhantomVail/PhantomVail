# 👾 PhantomVail

**Welcome to my lair...**

I'm a developer/programmer/coder (pick your poison) who revels in the arcane arts of:
- **C++**
- **HTML**
- **JavaScript**
- **C#**
- **Lua**
- ...and more...

By day, I craft **Roblox games**, **apps**, and occasionally dabble in the dark arts of **executors**.

## 🧛‍♂️ What I'm Brewing
- 👀 **Interests:** The bleeding edge of tech, cyberpunk aesthetics, and the thrill of the hunt in coding.
- 🌱 **Learning:** New languages, frameworks, and anything that feeds my hunger for knowledge.
- 💞️ **Collaboration:** Always on the lookout for kindred spirits to build something legendary.
- 📫 **Contact Me:** You can summon me at [@PhantomVail] on discord etc.

## 🎭 Unveil the Darkness
- **😄 Pronouns:** [he/him]
- **⚡ Dark Fact:** My code is my weapon, and the digital realm is my battleground.
-  I Sometimes am EVIL.
**Embrace the darkness. Code on.** 🕶️
